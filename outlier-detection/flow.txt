Project flow and req:
Mode 1: Outlier detection without classification- should work on all types of diff classes as classification is not required
    Algos: Feature Extraction and clustering with single cluster. Feature extraction should be hardcoded for more codelines if possible
    single cluster and the outlier is the one farthest from the centroid
    There should be an option to show the clustering plot to show how farther the outlier was from the cluster centroid
Mode 2: Classification along with outlier detection- Required dataset from internet OR a pretrained supervised model like resnet50
Mode 3:partition the input images into classes using clustering(3 classes)
Mode 4: If 3 or 4 classes are given of flowers but in some classes there is an image better fitting to another classes, find that

UI: Keep basic; select mode, upload images, and different result page for each mode
